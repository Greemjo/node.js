# Unicon-Study-NodeJS Team-1 Project

In this project our team will be using the new knowledge gained on Node.JS, PostgreSQL and other useful third-party libraries to jointly build an application.

##How to contribute (general workflow):

1. Configure git on your PC
`$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
`$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com`

2. Clone the remote repository to your PC
In your projects folder run
`$ git clone https://github.com/Greemjo/node.js.git`

This will create node.js folder and download all the files and folders from the repository

3. Work on the project (add new files, change existing files, etc.)
If you created new file on your PC, stage them to local repo with
`$ git add -A`

After putting changes in the staging area we can make them part of the local repository by committing them using git commit
`$ git commit -am "Description of the change"`

4. Update remote repository with your changes
`$ git push -u origin master`
